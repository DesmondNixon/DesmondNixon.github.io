                    My first internship is with MetricWire which is a company that aims to provide a powerful
                    researching tool to its
                    clients. Some current and upcoming clients for the company include: the National Institute on Drug
                    Abuse (NIDA), the
                    National Cancer Institute (NCI), Public Health Ontario (PHO), Brown University, Leipzig University,
                    and John Hopkins
                    University.
                    <p></p>
                    My current role within the company is as a Mobile Developer where I am writing tests to ensure the
                    integrity of the code
                    is up to par. In the future, I will be working on implementing more features and possibly doing some
                    front-end
                    development for their website.
