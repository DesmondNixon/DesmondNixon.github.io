                    The above is an image of the community service project I completed as a part of my Eagle Scout
                    journey. I achieved the Eagle Scout rank in July of 2021 marking the end of my 5 years as a member
                    of Scouts BSA. The project was a culmination of the skills and abilities I gained through this
                    experience.
                    <p> </p>For my project I replaced 10 garden beds at a local community garden -- many of the beds
                    were
                    old, rotting, and inaccessible to those with mobility impairments. The total cost of the project was
                    over $2,000 and I spent months organizing, fundraising, and carrying out the project. Despite the
                    restrictions Covid placed on progress, my troop and I worked hard to revitalize the garden and
                    create a clean, sturdy, and accessible space for the community.
