                    The above is an image of the community service project I completed as a part of my Eagle Scout journey. I achieved the Eagle Scout rank in July of 2021 marking the end of my 5 years as a member of Scouts BSA. The project was a culmination of the skills and abilities I gained through this experience. 
                <p></p>For my project I replaced 10 garden beds at a local community garden -- many of the beds were old, rotting, and inaccessible to those with mobility impairments. The total cost of the project was over $2,000 and I spent months organizing, fundraising, and carrying out the project. Despite the restrictions Covid placed on progress, my troop and I worked hard to revitalize the garden and create a clean, sturdy, and accessible space for the community.
